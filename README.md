# Lab Report Templates

These lab report templates, written in `LaTeX`, `LyX` and `Typst`, are specifically designed for our students at Institute of Technological Studies of Bizerte. They will be able to focus on technical content instead of formatting since their report writing process will be more efficient.

The following URLs will allow you to directly edit the `LaTeX` or `Typst` template online:
